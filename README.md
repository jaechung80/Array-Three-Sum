# Array Three Sum
## Interviewer Prompt
Given an array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum, write a function that returns an array of all triplets in the input array that sum to the target sum.


### Examples

```javascript
arrayThreeSum([12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6], 0)   //should return [[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]
arrayThreeSum([5, 6 , 1, -9 , 7, 3 , 2], 35)    //should return []
arrayThreeSum([1, 15, -5, 12 , -3, 6 , 2], 10)  //should return [[ -3, 1, 12 ]]
```

## Interviewer Strategy Guide
Let's think about time complexity.  If your interviewee tries to go down the path of trying all possible combintations of three integers, that will have a time complexity of O(n^3).  Try to encourage them to find a more optimal approach.

### Hints
- The input array is NOT sorted, we still can sort the input array and then use that sorted array to help us optimize the solution.
- Suggest to the interviewee to think of how they would handle optimizing this problem if they only had to sum two integers.  A three sum can be thought of as trying to find if two integers sum to target valued added to each integer in the input array.

For example:
```javascript
arrayThreeSum([11, -1, -10], 0) 
//can be broken down to the below:

//checking if 11 is going to be one of the integers: 11 + ? + ? = 0
arrayTwoSum([-1,-10], 11 + 0)

//checking if -1 is going to be one of the integers: -1 + ? + ? = 0
arrayTwoSum([11,-10], -1 + 0)

//checking if -10 is going to be one of the integers: -10 + ? + ? =0
arrayTwoSum([11,-1], -10 + 0)
```

## Solutions

**Optimized Solution 1**: O(n^2) time complexity, O(n) space complexity
```javascript
function arrayThreeSum(arr, targetSum){

  //sorts the input arr from least to greatest
  arr.sort((a, b) => a-b)

  const solution = []

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length-2; i++){
    let element = arr[i]
    let leftIndex = i + 1
    let rightIndex = arr.length - 1

    //for each element in the array check to see if any two other integers in the array add to the target sum
    while(leftIndex < rightIndex){
      let currentSum = element + arr[leftIndex] + arr[rightIndex]

      //if the currentSum is equal to the target sum add an array of those 3 integers to the solution array
      if(currentSum === targetSum){
        solution.push([element, arr[leftIndex], arr[rightIndex]])
        leftIndex ++
        rightIndex --
      } else if(currentSum > targetSum){
        rightIndex --
      } else if (currentSum < targetSum){
        leftIndex ++
      }
    }
  }
  return solution
}
```


**Optimized Solution 2**: O(n^2) time complexity, O(n) space complexity
- Note that this solution does not return a sorted solution like Solution 1

```javascript
function arrayThreeSum(arr, targetSum){
  const solution = []
  for(let i = 0; i< arr.length-1; i++){
    //the sum needed given we already know one element arr[i]
    let currentSum = targetSum - arr[i]
    //create a hash table to store all of the integers from arr[i] we have tried
    let memo ={}
    for (let j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++){
      if(memo[currentSum-arr[j]]){
        solution.push([arr[i], currentSum-arr[j], arr[j]])
      }else{
        memo[arr[j]] = true
      }
    }
  }
  return solution
}
```
